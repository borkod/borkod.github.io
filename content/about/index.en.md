I am a Cloud Solutions architect and DevOps Engineer with varied experience in system implementation and integration at large enterprise clients across number of industries (federal public sector, financial services, retail). My expertise focus is in delivery of end-to-end enterprise architectures leveraging public cloud providers Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) and solution design utilizing cloud native technologies, particularly Kubernetes. Further, I have a strong background in enterprise security and DevOps delivery methods.

Throughout my varied experience, I’ve had opportunities to engage with and work alongside clients at all levels of seniority and diverse industry backgrounds, helping them utilize modern technology applications to transform their businesses. With my expertise, I guide customers through various architectural design decisions and tradeoffs, while always keeping client’s goals and expectations in focus.

I have obtained a number of relevant and prominent certifications: Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA), Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD), Azure Solutions Architect Expert, Azure DevOps Engineer Expert, Azure Developer Associate, Azure Security Engineer Associate, AWS Certified Solution Architect (Professional), AWS Certified DevOps Engineer (Professional), AWS Certified Developer, AWS Security Specialty Certified, AWS Database Specialty Certified, HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate, TOGAF Certified, and ITIL Certified. In addition, I hold Canada Top Secret Clearance.

Besides my professional activities, I volunteer as a technical manuscript reviewer for Manning publications. It's something I particularly enjoy because it grants me exposure to new technical topics (and I receive free books!) I am also very active in a number of local community technology groups.

Prior to my professional career, I completed a Master of Science in Physics degree from University of Waterloo. I also hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree and a Bachelor of Science in Physics degree from University of New Brunswick.
