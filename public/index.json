The Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) program focuses on Kubernetes cluster administration topics with special attention given to cluster installation, configuration and maintenance, networking, security, and troubleshooting. The Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) exam places focus on defining Kubernetes resources and primitives related to deploying applications on top of the platform. I ended up writing both exams and was successful in obtaining both certifications. In contrast to many certification exams, these tests are all hands-on exercises with no academic or multiple choice questions. Both exams are challenging in their own respect. Common to both tests is that you’re really time constrained. My experience was that you had to work through the questions very quickly in order to complete the exam and do well. CKA exam is longer, covers more content and wider range of topics, and requires a deeper knowledge and understanding of networking and Linux OS administration. CKAD is easier in a sense that it is shorter and covers less topics. However, it provides less time on per question basis, making it also a challenging test. CNCF recently announced addition of a new Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS) program. I will definitely be looking to write that exam once the certification becomes generally available in November.

Udemy also has a couple of good courses for those interested in preparing for the exams (CKA and CKAD). All of these courses provide hands-on exercises for gaining practical familiarity working with Kubernetes. From my experience, I would recommend Udemy courses slightly over the Linux Foundation courses, especially taking into account the price and value. For exercises, there are a lot of resource to be found online. Kubernetes The Hard Way is the canonical go-to resource for anybody looking to delve deep into cluster administration (and preparing for the CKA exam). I found this GitHub repo to contain a pretty complete list of review exercises for CKAD exam. The best and final tip I would offer is to just stand up a Kubernetes cluster and start developing.

These services route end-user traffic to the available backend based on configurable routing rules. They also feature endpoint monitoring in order to improve high availability and reliability of backend services. Azure offers two global load-balancing services: Azure Traffic Manager and Azure Front Door. Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic load balancer that distributes traffic to services across global Azure regions. Being a DNS-based load-balancing service, it load balances only at the domain level. As such, it supports any communication protocol and has no performance impact. Front Door is global load balancing service specifically designed for web applications. Therefore, it works at Layer 7 and offers many capabilities useful for web-based application (e.g SSL offloading, path-based routing, fast fail-over, caching, WAF, etc.) I thought it would be useful to compile a list of features offered by the two services so that they can be easily and quickly compared and contrasted. Azure documentation offers a very practical decision tree that’s great for determining the right load-balancing solution for various scenarios. I hope the table below is helpful!

Azure Functions allows developers to deploy code connecting to data sources or messaging solutions thus enabling easier implementation of event driven processing of messages. Azure Functions, like rest of serverless computing, is designed to accelerate and simplify application development by removing the responsibility of infrastructure management. Azure Functions uses concept of bindings as a way of declaratively connecting another resource to the function. Bindings may be connected as input bindings, output bindings, or both, and can be used as triggers for message and event processing. Few commonly used Azure Function bindings are: Blog Storage Cosmos DB Event Grid Event Hubs If implementing in JavaScript, bindings are specified in function.json as shown in below example: { \"type\": \"eventHubTrigger\", \"name\": \"eventHubMessages\", \"direction\": \"in\", \"eventHubName\": \"defaulthub\", \"connection\": \"eventsamples_defaultReadPolicy_EVENTHUB\" } Here, eventsamples_defaultReadPolicy_EVENTHUB refers to the Azure Function Application Setting that specifies the Event Hub Connection strings. Similar binding definitions are available for other supported services. It is possible to specify few other parameters in the binding definition. For example, the above trigger binding for Event Hubs can include additional parameters for cardinality or the consumer group: { ... \"cardinality\": \"many\", \"consumerGroup\": \"default\" } One issue arises if we wish to re-use the same function with only a single change that is the target consumer group. Ideally we would want to set the consumer group in an environmental variable in the application settings. How does one load in a consumer group from an Application setting? Similar problem can occur with other binding sources. For example, path setting for Blob storage, databaseName or collectionName for Cosmos DB. A nice trick I recently found was to use binding expressions. In your function.json file, you can specify consumer group name inside % symbol: { ... \"consumerGroup\": \"%customGroupName%\" ... } Then add an Application setting with corresponding name (customGroupName in this case). Here are couple of screenshots of the function settings and application settings with these updates. Consumer group will then be resolved to the value in Application Settings at startup. Same method can be used for binding for other services and it works for trigger, input, and output bindings. Hope this is helpful!

Last week I had the opportunity to attend the conference in Toronto. As usual at these types of events, there was “The Hub”, a central meeting place where large number of sponsors had booths set up demonstrating their products or services and giving out SWAG. The Hub also contained three theaters that featured 15-minute lightning sessions on technical topics from Microsoft experts or customer discussion panels. The conference agenda was also packed with deep-dive breakout sessions on large variety of topics. ⚡️ “Highlights from #MSIgniteTheTour Toronto Day 1”https://t.co/oPvCLNWS1a — Microsoft IT Pro Canada (@MS_ITProCA) January 8, 2020 ","date":"2020-01-11","objectID":"/microsoft-ignite-the-tour-toronto-recap/:0:0","tags":["Azure","Microsoft","Microsoft Ignite the Tour","Toronto","Recap"],"title":"Microsoft Ignite the Tour Toronto Recap","uri":"/microsoft-ignite-the-tour-toronto-recap/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Learning Paths A unique and differentiating aspect of this conference was that the breakout sessions consisted of Learning Paths. These were essentially educational sessions connected around a common theme. Learning Paths focused on several themes, including Dynamics 365, Microsoft Teams, Windows, AI, Azure, among others. I attended sessions of the two Learning Path tracks that seemed most pertinent to me, Developing cloud native applications and Modernizing web applications and data. Each Learning Path breakout session aimed its attention at a different technical aspect, e.g. migrating data, compute or data storage services, operations, etc. Another interesting and unique element of the learning paths is that they were all linked via a common story dealing with a fictitious company “Tailwind Traders”. Every individual session presented a scenario that was used to illustrate some technical capabilities and services provided by Azure. Tailwind Traders is a collection of Azure reference apps used to showcase Azure technology. Although this scenario-based format is very effective as a teaching method, I think I would have preferred if breakout sessions involved real-life customer stories instead. The sessions were capped at 45 minutes and there was no time for any Q and A during the sessions. Instead, the presenters were available for Q and A at the Microsoft Showcase booth in The Hub. I didn’t particularly like this. There is a lot of learning value in hearing questions or issues brought up by others in the audience and having answers shared with the entire group. All breakout sessions used speech to text to provide real-time subtitles of the presenter lecture. Kudos go to Microsoft for improving accessibility to the conference sessions in this way. 👍 For myself, the highlights of the breakout sessions were the two presentations given by Aaron Wislang (@as_w). The first session was APPS30: Modernizing Your Application with Containers. This was followed by a second session on APPS40: Consolidating Infrastructure with Azure Kubernetes Service. Both presentations were very well prepared and adeptly communicated to the audience. The content of the talks presented a great review of fundamentals of container technology and an introduction to the related services in the Azure cloud platform. The demos were also effective in illustrating the concepts and services discussed in the presentation. I also recommend visiting Aaron’s compilation of useful Kubernetes resources. Another notable session I attended was by April Edwards (@theapriledwards) titled [MOD50 Managing Delivery of your App via DevOps](https://github.com/microsoft/ignite-learning-paths-training-mod/tree/master/mod50). The talk was very well polished and presented. It provided the audience a very good introductory overview DevOps and CI/CD. I liked that there was a focus on people and culture as much as technology. For the technical aspects, the session presented a good introduction to Azure DevOps for those not familiar with the platform. It included demonstrations of Azure DevOps integration with Github Actions, canary deployments utilizing deployment slots, and approval gates.
